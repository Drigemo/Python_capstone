Remove when pastry is rich golden color.\nServe hot.",

(This step can be done and advance and refrigerated overnight.)\nGrate cheeses and cabbage.\nSlice baguette into 1/4 slices on a slight diagonal angle.  Place on a cooking sheet.  (Consider lining with foil for easy clean-up since you will spoon the mixture on to each slice.)\nCombine the cheese and cabbage with the cooked chorizo.  Using a spoon, top each baguette slice with one or two spoonfuls.\nHeat in the oven for 10 minutes to allow for cheese to melt and bread to get crispy.",

Slowly whisk in the milk, increase the heat to medium-high and bring to a simmer, stirring constantly, simmer for about 2 minutes to thicken. Remove from heat, add nutmeg, 1/8 t. salt, a bit of fresh ground black pepper, 1/4 c. shredded Gruyere and 1/4 c. Parmesan. Stir to combine, set aside.\nOn another baking sheet, place the bread slices. Bake for 5 minutes, flip bread and bake about another 4 minutes (keeping an eye on it), until the bread is lightly toasted. Remove from oven. Spread 4 of the slices lightly with Dijon mustard, top with a layer of ham, a few asparagus spears and half the remaining Gruyere cheese. Top with the remaining toasted bread. Slather the tops of the sandwiches with some of the bechamel sauce and top with the rest of the cheese. Bake sandwiches for 5 minutes, then broil until bubbly and golden, about another 3-5 minutes. Serve sandwiches topped with a poached or fried egg.",
